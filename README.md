Just a backup in case the [original repo](https://github.com/nsilvestri/solarized-dark-for-wsl) vanishes.

Comment ? Télécharger le repo, et lancer `install.vbs`. Relancer le terminal (WSL Ubuntu). C'tout.

Adapted the Ubuntu-fier for use with Solarized Dark, and took away the font installing part, so now all it does is change registry keys. To use, just download the zip, extract, and run `install.vbs`.

KO / You're probably better off just using this [pure registry version](https://gist.github.com/noelbundick/d7d67c1cc9cae8a1cb93240dc7bbe78c#file-solarized-dark-reg).
